**The Led Mod**

A complete overhaul for Planetary Annihilation, originally based on Stuart98's mod Galactic Annihilation.

This mod completely changes most units' weapons, movement, vision, and many units' resource costs and roles.
The goal of this mod is to create more aggressive engagement between players, and to force players to be active on the map.

Additionally, because there are many groups active on the map at the same time, this mod is intended to make battles more tactical.
In theory, instead of having a large, pitched battle, players will be 'engaged' and actively fighting for an extended period of time.
Units will be dying on both sides, and reinforcements will be arriving, either helping from elsewhere on the map or directly from factories.

This mod forces artillery, air support, orbital support, and nuclear support into a "force multiplier" role instead of being independent weapons.
Therefore, players should be constantly maneuvering ground forces all over the map, and also supporting their armies from great distances.
Players will have limited ground forces with which to control many areas of the map, forcing them to split up.
And players will have limited support options available with which to support a significant number of separate armies.

**GAMEPLAY NOTES**

This mod may be frustrating for players who start a match expecting gameplay similar to vanilla Planetary Annihilation.

To help ensure that players know what to expect, here are a few suggestions:

-----
**1) INTELLIGENCE IS KEY**

There is no surface radar. This means if you want to find out where the enemy is, you are going to have to send scouts.

Most units have quite poor vision range, such as tanks having longer weapon range than they have sight range. 
You will need to position other units in front of them to make most effective use their long-range weapons.

Scouts are very important units, as they have better vision than most of your heavier combat forces.
Recon units should accompany any large army, and should usually scout ahead as well.

Note that not all recon units are unarmed or fragile, some are quite serviceable as combat units in their own right.

-----
**2) COMBINED ARMS**

Bots and vehicles behave very differently in this mod.

Bots are your infantry. They are cheap and numerous, with excellent DPS and HP efficiency for cost.
However, bots tend to have short range and generally slow movement.
This means they are excellent for holding ground, as they will trade well in a straight-up fight.

Vehicles are more expensive, and have higher HP and stronger weapons.
Tanks in particular are very expensive compared to bots, and have large amounts of HP and powerful cannons.
However, without support, tanks may be overwhelmed by numbers, or swarmed at point-blank. They are also vulnerable to being picked off by high-damage weaponry.

What this means is you should deploy a mixed force where several unit types cover each others' weaknesses.
For example, deploying a group of Dox in front of a couple tanks will provide vision and screen against an enemy closing to range with your tanks.
And the tanks provide supporting fire, since the Dox may not be able to engage every type of enemy effectively on their own.

**3) FIRE SUPPORT**

Artillery and planes are extremely powerful in this mod; with several times more range and explosive power than in vanilla PA.
However, because there is no surface radar, in order to use these weapons effectively you must have vision on the target.
Planes also tend to not have vision of surface units, and your ground forces will need to spot targets for them to attack.

It is entirely possible for a smaller force to engage and destroy a much larger enemy army by relying on artillery and air support.
But deploying too much artillery or air support potentially leaves you weak on the ground, and unable to find targets for those weapons to attack.

The right mix of scouts, troops, tanks, and several types of support options will depend on many variables, and will usually vary in different locations on the map.

-----
**4) ANTI AIR**

Planes have been substantially changed in terms of game mechanics. There are two broad categories of "planes" in this mod. 

First, low-altitude "helicopter" aircraft constructed from the Air Factory. 
Although these "helo" units are somewhat faster than ground forces, compared to planes they are quite slow-moving.
These units can get vision of ground units on their own.
In fact, arguably the most powerful unit in this mod is the unarmed air scout, because it has such large vision range.

Second, high altitude "fast mover" aircraft, constructed from either the Advanced Air Factory, or from the Orbital Factory.
These are orbital units, and cannot see any enemy units on a planet's surface.
In order to attack the surface, ground units must spot the enemy first.

Because of this distiction, anti-air may be able to attack helo, planes, or both.
A wide variety of weapons may attack low-altitude aircraft, including many weapons meant primarily to attack ground targets.
Generally, serious anti-air is necessary in order to reach high-altitude planes.
These heavier anti-air weapons tend to have long range, and excellent firepower.
Generally, air units cannot survive more than one or two hits from AA weapons.

Because of its speed and firepower, flying units can be a decisive strategic weapon when used judiciously.
Deploying a few air units also forces the enemy to spend resources on AA, dividing their efforts further.
Overinvestment in planes, however, will cause the enemy's AA to rack up an enormous profit in resources wasted on dead planes.

-----
**5) NUKES**

The changes to nukes are likely to be a shock to players not expecting them.

Long story short, nukes are now extremely cheap. A nuke launcher costs 2000 metal, and each nuke costs 5000 metal.
However, nukes are also much smaller and less destructive than in vanilla PA.
Although a nuke will still vaporize almost anything with a direct hit, the size of the blast is dramatically reduced.

Antinuke is also extremely cheap, available at T1, and covers a larger area.
To avoid the possibility of a fast nuke aimed at your industrial base, it would be wise to construct an antinuke very early.

In short, "the nuclear option" is now a completely standard component of every player's playbook.
Any army that is too large, or any problem you can't solve becomes a viable target for a nuclear missile.
Virtually every player should have at least one nuke on hand, just in case.
If the moment comes when you need a nuke, you probably need it RIGHT NOW and won't have time to construct it from scratch.
